# 🧠 DSA-by-Amruta

This repository documents my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
Each problem is organized by topic and written with:
- Clean and **well-commented** Java code  
- **Step-by-step explanations** of logic and approach  
- **Key learnings** from every problem solved  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Strengthen **problem-solving** and **logical reasoning**  
- Build strong **foundations for technical interviews**  
- Develop **daily consistency** and a deeper understanding of core concepts
